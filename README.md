# Architecture Summit - Group Assignment 2

## Cloning a repository, writing YAML, and testing Docker Compose

## Overview

This is called a README file. It's written in a markup language called Markdown. GitHub offers a [great article](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) on markdown and how to write it. You may also find the [cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) handy. It's fantastic to refer back to from time-to-time.

Readme files are the first impression of your project. Make sure to put useful information. Take it as an opportunity to educate and excite others about the work you've done.


One of my favorite markdown tools is the [Markdown list generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). Now you can represent tables with ease!

| Animal | Ranking | Indoor |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Cat    | 1       | True   |
| Dog    | 2       | True   |
| Alpaca | 3       | False  |
| Sheep  | 4       | True   |

## Embedded Images

You can even include embedded images in the readme like I've done below.
